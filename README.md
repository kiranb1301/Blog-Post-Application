<h1>Dynamic Blog Post Application</h1>
<h2>Project Overview :</h2> <br>
The Dynamic Blog Post Application is a web-based platform that allows users to create and share blog posts, react to others' ideas, and comment on posts.
Although there is no specific real-world problem it addresses, this project has been created for practice purposes using a proper technology stack.
It focuses on implementing user authentication, protected routes, and dynamic interactions between users and posts. <br>

<h2> Key Features: </h2><br> 
<ul>User Management: User Registration, Login, Logout, profile management, password reset or change functionality. </ul>

<ul>Commenting System: Users can comment on their own or others' blog posts.</ul>
<ul>Protected Routes: All important routes, such as posting, commenting, and reacting, are protected using Django's login_required decorator to ensure only authenticated users can access them.</ul> 
<ul>User-Friendly Interface: The application uses Bootstrap to provide a responsive and clean user interface.</ul>
